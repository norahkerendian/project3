        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our plot features an interactive map of Colombia, displaying information about the rate of dengue cases per capita for selected municipalities. The primary target audience for this visualization includes health officials and researchers, who can use it to assess regional variations in dengue cases, while residents may also find it useful to understand the health risks in their own areas. Understanding the distribution of dengue is critical because it helps identify hotspots, allocate resources effectively, and guide interventions to mitigate the spread of the disease. This visualization specifically helps answer our main question: How does the dengue rate vary between different municipalities of Colombia? Users also have the option to filter municipalities based on their average minimum population and the minimum number of dengue cases. It's important to note that not all municipalities on the map report dengue cases because the merging of our two datasets (coordinates and case numbers) did not result in perfect matches for all municipalities. However, this merge provided the best combination compared to other datasets we explored. We do acknowledge that gaps in data reporting and incomplete municipality matches may limit the comprehensiveness of the visualization, particularly in rural or underreported areas.
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We chose to base our visualization on a map because we felt it was the most effective way to show the spread of dengue cases across municipalities, enabling viewers to identify patterns and better understand the data. To represent the rate of dengue cases per capita in each municipality, we used dots on the map. The size and color of each dot follow a five-level scale. We selected a red color scale that starts light for the lowest rates and gradually darkens as the rate increases. The dot sizes also increase with the rate, further reinforcing this visual hierarchy. The specific ranges for these levels were determined by dividing the total rate of dengue cases per capita into five evenly spaced intervals. These details are clearly interpretable with the help of the legend on the left side of the visualization.
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Initially, we considered using five distinct colors for the dots, each representing a different range of rates, without changing the dot sizes. However, this approach was less intuitive and resulted in a cluttered, disorganized map. It was difficult for viewers to determine which color represented which rate range without constantly referring to the legend. We ultimately chose our current design because it is more intuitive and visually appealing, allowing viewers to interpret the data with minimal reliance on the legend unless they want more details.
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Additionally, each dot on the map includes a hover tooltip that provides more information about the corresponding municipality, such as its name, average number of cases, average population, and percentage of cases per capita. Originally, we set the tooltip to appear on click, but we switched to a hover interaction. This change makes it easier for users to explore the map and view information for different municipalities quickly, without needing to click and re-click to dismiss the tooltip. The hover interaction enhances the user experience, making it more seamless and user-friendly.
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Regarding the two sliders at the top right, which filter based on minimum population and minimum dengue cases, we opted to use sliders to add an additional layer of interactivity to the data. The sliders are designed to work together, helping users explore how the rate of dengue cases varies in municipalities that meet the selected criteria. We also considered using time-based filters (for the years 2007-2019) to provide a temporal perspective on how case rates have changed over time. However, we decided to keep the current filters because they align better with the map and offer a clearer, more immediate view of the distribution of cases. This approach allows users to focus on specific areas of interest without being overwhelmed by the entire dataset.

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first step in the development process was to create the base of the project, which involved mapping the country of Colombia. Our goal was to display all of the 1,000+ municipalities that our dataset focused on. To achieve this, we needed a JSON dataset containing not only the municipality names but also their coordinates (latitude and longitude). Once we found the appropriate dataset, the next challenge was to plot this data on an interactive map. We chose to use the JS Leaflet library, which was approved by our professor for this purpose. The most time-consuming part of this process was finding the dataset with accurate municipality coordinates, as most available resources were in Spanish, and I do not speak Spanish. This made it particularly challenging to locate and verify the data. Including time spent finding the dataset and learning how to use Leaflet, this portion of the project took approximately 3-4 hours to complete.
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The second step was to add circles to the map for each municipality. To do this we merged our data from Physionet with location data for each municipality from simplemaps then converted the table into cases.json which only contained municipality name, code, case data, population data, and latitude and longitude. From here we mapped a circle onto each municipality onto the existing map using the coordinates. The radius of the circle is proportional to the average number of cases divided by the average population from 2007-2019 and so is the color which was split into 5 bins. This part of the project took 3-4 hours to complete.  
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Creating the sliders for filtering allows readers to dynamically assess the rates of dengue across Colombia. This involved including range inputs in the html page that affect the circles that are taken off of the map based on their number of cases and/or population attributes as a filter. This part took about 3 hours. Adding the text blocks to the page was slightly more complicated than anticipated because of how the map background was set up. We had to specifically add label elements that overlapped with the map. This part took about 1 hour including initial styling.
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To help provide context to the visualization and streamline the user interaction and avoid confusion, we added a tooltip and legend with our visual encodings. Our goal with the hover tooltip was to make it easy for viewers to extract more information about a municipality they were curious about. We decided to provide relevant statistics (average case, average population and case per capita) regarding dengue cases. This involved making it so that the tooltip properly appeared and disappeared with the user's interaction with the circles on the map. The legend was created for users to reference the visual encodings on the map and to help with understanding how the change in size and color related to the rate of cases in Colombia. We also decided to include the exact range of rate of dengue cases per capita the color and size were encoded to in the legend to avoid any discrepancies of how we went about identifying what a “high” or “low” rate was. Finally, we worked on creating a cohesive style. We wanted to keep the visualization clean and simple so that viewers could easily draw conclusions and interact with the map with as little difficulty and confusion as possible. This was done mostly through css styling and rearrangement of elements like the title, interactions and legend. In total, these additions to the project took 3-4 hours to complete. 
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In total, we spent roughly 18 hours on this project including our group meetings. We spent a significant amount of our time figuring out how to place the circles on the map because the data from Physionet didn’t provide any geographic information. We settled upon merging the Physionet data with data from simplemaps which provided latitude and longitude for most municipalities.
